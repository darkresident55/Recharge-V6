# About The Soft Chimp Locomotion Package.
This is the Locomotion used In Chimps Life, Recharge, and Some Other Games out there, Anemunt and Terminal made it, and The Rights belong to Both of them

# Movement Properties

The Locomotion Has some Properties you can edit Inside the Chimp Empty,

Inside the empty will be a Motion Settings script, That script allows you to edit the movement from there Simply,

But if you're feeling A Bit Experimental?

Then Go Inside hands and Select both the Left and Right Emptys, Inside will be the main Core of the locomotion, which allows you to move!

# Setup

Apart from that, The Locomotion is pretty easy to set up, Go To the Soft Chimp Locomotion and Drag the Soft Chimp Locomotion Prefab into the scene,

and The Movement Should Work on The Default Settings ( Between In Motion Settings )

# Thank you for using the movement And Enjoy Using it!
